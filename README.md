# Airbnb Dataset Analysis and ML Model

This project aims to perform initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) and build a baseline machine learning model for the Airbnb dataset.

## Introduction

This repository contains code and notebooks for analyzing Airbnb listing data and building predictive models. The analysis explores patterns in pricing, location, amenities, and other features that affect listing popularity and pricing. The baseline machine learning model provides a foundation for predicting listing prices based on various features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project requires Python 3.8+ and the packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/airbnb-analysis.git
   cd airbnb-analysis
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # Using venv
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: In-depth analysis of Airbnb listing characteristics
- **Data Visualization**: Various plots highlighting key insights from the data
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of relevant features for modeling
- **Baseline ML Model**: Initial predictive model for listing prices

## Usage

1. Data folder has been added to .gitignore. Upload the files to the data folder
2. Start with the EDA notebooks to understand the dataset
3. Explore the modeling notebooks to see how the baseline model was built
4. Use the scripts in the `src` directory for your own analysis
